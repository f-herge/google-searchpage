# Build the Google.com search results page using HTML and CSS

Extension of my last project (https://github.com/f-herge/google-homepage) replicating the Google.com landing page. 
There is a lot of varied content on this webpage, so the project was more complex and provided solid HTML and CSS experience.

I aimed to write clear semantic HTML, and learnt about writing HTML with accessibility in mind.

This also allowed me to practice using Git forks and pull requests as I submitted my solution to the project page. 

*The project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).*
